## quick start

### Training on Metal Lyrics Dataset

For training on the comprehensive metal lyrics dataset, first prepare the data:

```sh
python backend/data/DarkLyrics/prepare.py
```

This creates a `train.bin` and `val.bin` in that data directory. Now it is time to train your GPT:

```sh
cd backend/training
python train.py ../config/train_darklyrics.py
```

### Training on Metal Lyrics Dataset (Full Power)

For a more substantial training experience using the comprehensive metal lyrics dataset:

**Step 1: Prepare the metal lyrics dataset**
```sh
python backend/data/DarkLyrics/prepare.py
```

This processes your metal lyrics dataset and creates the necessary training files (`train.bin`, `val.bin`, `meta.pkl`).

**Step 2: Train the model**
```sh
cd backend/training
python train.py ../config/train_darklyrics.py
```

This config is optimized for RTX 3050 GPUs (8GB VRAM) and will train a GPT model on metal lyrics. Training will take several hours but will create a model capable of generating lyrics in various metal styles.

**Step 3: Generate lyrics**
```sh
cd backend/training
python sample.py --out_dir=out-darklyrics
```

This will generate new metal lyrics based on the patterns learned from your dataset.

**Step 4: Interactive Chat (ENHANCED!)**
```sh
cd backend/training
python interactive_chat.py
```

This launches an interactive chat interface where you can have real-time conversations with your trained ATOM-GPT model! Features:
- 🎤 **Real-time chat** with your metal lyrics AI
- ✏️ **Sentence completion mode** - Focused continuations for unfinished sentences
- 🧠 **Adaptive sampling** - automatically adjusts to prompt type (creative, thematic, questions, commands)
- 🌡️ **Adjustable temperature** for creativity control
- 🎯 **Configurable response length**
- 🤘 **Metal-themed interface** with helpful commands
- 🔍 **Enhanced quality filtering** and artifact removal
- 🎭 **Mode switching** between chat and completion modes

### Quick Test Run

To verify everything works before starting full training:

```sh
cd backend/training
python train.py ../config/test_darklyrics.py
```

This will train a small model in ~10 minutes and verify your setup is working.

### Hardware Requirements

- **RTX 3050 (8GB)**: Use `train_darklyrics.py` config (optimized)
- **Higher-end GPUs**: You can increase `batch_size`, `n_layer`, `n_embd` in the config
- **CPU only**: Reduce model size significantly and expect much slower training

If you peek inside the config files, you'll see training parameters optimized for different scenarios. The `train_darklyrics.py` config trains a GPT with 8 layers, 8 attention heads, and 512 embedding dimensions - perfect for RTX 3050. Training takes several hours and model checkpoints are saved to `backend/out-darklyrics`. 

**Monitor your training:**
- Watch the terminal for loss values (lower is better)
- Training will automatically save checkpoints
- Use Ctrl+C to stop training early if needed

**Expected Results:**
- Initial loss: ~4.0 (random)
- Good training loss: ~1.5-2.0 
- Training time: 4-8 hours on RTX 3050

```

### Sentence Completion Mode ✏️

ATOM-GPT now includes a specialized sentence completion mode for focused text continuations:

**Usage:**
```sh
# Start interactive chat
cd backend/training  
python interactive_chat.py

# Switch to completion mode
/complete

# Enter incomplete sentences
When the rainfall of tears drop...
In the darkness of the void...
Fire burns through ancient steel...
```

**Example Completions:**
```
✏️ Complete: When the rainfall of tears drop
✏️ Completion: When the rainfall of tears drop like molten steel upon the cursed earth.

✏️ Complete: In the shadows of eternity
✏️ Completion: In the shadows of eternity where forgotten souls writhe in endless torment.
```

### Custom Dataset Training

To train on your own text dataset:

1. **Prepare your data**: Create a `.txt` file with your text
2. **Create data folder**: Put it in `backend/data/your_dataset/input.txt`
3. **Copy prepare script**: Use `backend/data/DarkLyrics/prepare.py` as template
4. **Create config**: Copy and modify `train_darklyrics.py` with your dataset name
5. **Train**: Run training with your new config

### GPU Memory Optimization

If you run into CUDA out-of-memory errors:

1. **Reduce batch_size**: Try 4 or 2 instead of 8
2. **Reduce block_size**: Try 256 or 384 instead of 512  
3. **Reduce model size**: Lower `n_layer`, `n_head`, or `n_embd`
4. **Increase gradient_accumulation_steps**: Compensates for smaller batch_size

#### Before vs After Examples

**Creative Prompt: "write a verse about darkness"**
```
Before: ] I am the shadow of the night The cold winds collide
After:  In the depths where shadows reign
        Ancient whispers call my name
        Through the void of endless night
        Where no soul can find the light
```

**Question: "what is black metal?"**
```
Before: ] [Lyrics not available...] Band: DARKTHRONE
After:  Black metal is characterized by fast tempos,
        shrieking vocals, and atmospheric darkness
        that emerged from Norway in the early 1990s
```

**Command: "describe fire"**
```
Before: ] I drink from the ground and in the clouds
After:  Flames dance with ancient fury,
        consuming all in their path,
        bringing both destruction and renewal
```

This generates a few samples, for example:

```
I close my eyes, and let the demons in
To clear my mind from the things that I have seen
On my knees, Father - please leave the crowd
And let me out
I lost my way so many times before
That I forgot just what I'm living for
I'm in the dark, light's so hard to find...
So now I'm leaving it all behind - I'm changing skin
My angry tears like raindrops in the dust
I realized there's no one you can trust
Shot in the back sinking in the night
That's how I'm leaving it all behind - I'm changing skin
```

lol  `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`. Not bad for a character-level model after 3 minutes of training on a GPU. Better results are quite likely obtainable by instead finetuning a pretrained GPT-2 model on this dataset (see finetuning section later).

**I only have a macbook** (or other cheap computer). No worries, we can still train a GPT but we want to dial things down a notch. I recommend getting the bleeding edge PyTorch nightly ([select it here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) when installing) as it is currently quite likely to make your code more efficient. But even without it, a simple train run could look as follows:

```sh
python train.py backend/config/test_darklyrics.py --device=cpu --compile=False
```

Here, since we are running on CPU instead of GPU we must set `--device=cpu` and also turn off PyTorch 2.0 compile with `--compile=False`. This will train a small model on the metal lyrics dataset. You can then sample from it:

```sh
python sample.py --out_dir=out-darklyrics-test --device=cpu
```

```
GLEORKEN VINGHARD III:
Whell's the couse, the came light gacks,
And the for mought you in Aut fries the not high shee
bot thou the sought bechive in that to doth groan you,
No relving thee post mose the wear
```

Not bad for ~3 minutes on a CPU, for a hint of the right character gestalt. If you're willing to wait longer, feel free to tune the hyperparameters, increase the size of the network, the context length (`--block_size`), the length of training, etc.

Finally, on Apple Silicon Macbooks and with a recent PyTorch version make sure to add `--device=mps` (short for "Metal Performance Shaders"); PyTorch then uses the on-chip GPU that can *significantly* accelerate training (2-3X) and allow you to use larger networks. See [Issue 28](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/issues/28) for more.

## reproducing GPT-2

A more serious deep learning professional may be more interested in reproducing GPT-2 results. So here we go - we first tokenize the dataset, in this case the [OpenWebText](https://openwebtext2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), an open reproduction of OpenAI's (private) WebText:

```sh
python data/openwebtext/prepare.py
```

This downloads and tokenizes the [OpenWebText](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openwebtext) dataset. It will create a `train.bin` and `val.bin` which holds the GPT2 BPE token ids in one sequence, stored as raw uint16 bytes. Then we're ready to kick off training. To reproduce GPT-2 (124M) you'll want at least an 8X A100 40GB node and run:

```sh
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 train.py config/train_gpt2.py
```

This will run for about 4 days using PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) and go down to loss of ~2.85. Now, a GPT-2 model just evaluated on OWT gets a val loss of about 3.11, but if you finetune it it will come down to ~2.85 territory (due to an apparent domain gap), making the two models ~match.

If you're in a cluster environment and you are blessed with multiple GPU nodes you can make GPU go brrrr e.g. across 2 nodes like:

```sh
# Run on the first (master) node with example IP 123.456.123.456:
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=0 --master_addr=123.456.123.456 --master_port=1234 train.py
# Run on the worker node:
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=1 --master_addr=123.456.123.456 --master_port=1234 train.py
```

It is a good idea to benchmark your interconnect (e.g. iperf3). In particular, if you don't have Infiniband then also prepend `NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1` to the above launches. Your multinode training will work, but most likely _crawl_. By default checkpoints are periodically written to the `--out_dir`. We can sample from the model by simply `python sample.py`.

Finally, to train on a single GPU simply run the `python train.py` script. Have a look at all of its args, the script tries to be very readable, hackable and transparent. You'll most likely want to tune a number of those variables depending on your needs.

## baselines

OpenAI GPT-2 checkpoints allow us to get some baselines in place for openwebtext. We can get the numbers as follows:

```sh
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2.py
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2_medium.py
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2_large.py
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2_xl.py
```

and observe the following losses on train and val:

| model | params | train loss | val loss |
| ------| ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| gpt2 | 124M         | 3.11  | 3.12     |
| gpt2-medium | 350M  | 2.85  | 2.84     |
| gpt2-large | 774M   | 2.66  | 2.67     |
| gpt2-xl | 1558M     | 2.56  | 2.54     |

However, we have to note that GPT-2 was trained on (closed, never released) WebText, while OpenWebText is just a best-effort open reproduction of this dataset. This means there is a dataset domain gap. Indeed, taking the GPT-2 (124M) checkpoint and finetuning on OWT directly for a while reaches loss down to ~2.85. This then becomes the more appropriate baseline w.r.t. reproduction.

## finetuning

For finetuning on the metal lyrics dataset, you can create a new config that initializes from a pretrained GPT-2 checkpoint. Unlike training from scratch, finetuning can take very little time, e.g. on a single GPU just a few minutes.

To create a finetuning config:
1. Copy `backend/config/train_darklyrics.py` 
2. Add `init_from = 'gpt2'` to initialize from pretrained GPT-2
3. Lower the learning rate (e.g., `learning_rate = 1e-5`)
4. Reduce max_iters (e.g., `max_iters = 1000`)

The finetuned model will generate metal lyrics with better language structure since it starts from a pretrained checkpoint.

## sampling / inference

Use the script `sample.py` to sample either from pre-trained GPT-2 models released by OpenAI, or from a model you trained yourself. For example, here is a way to sample from the largest available `gpt2-xl` model:

```sh
python sample.py \
    --init_from=gpt2-xl \
    --start="What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?" \
    --num_samples=5 --max_new_tokens=100
```

If you'd like to sample from a model you trained, use the `--out_dir` to point the code appropriately. You can also prompt the model with some text from a file, e.g. ```python sample.py --start=FILE:prompt.txt```.

### Interactive Sampling

For a more engaging experience, use the interactive chat interface:

```sh
cd backend/training
python interactive_chat.py
```

This provides real-time conversation capabilities with your trained ATOM-GPT model, complete with adjustable settings and a metal-themed interface.

## efficiency notes

For simple model benchmarking and profiling, `bench.py` might be useful. It's identical to what happens in the meat of the training loop of `train.py`, but omits much of the other complexities.

Note that the code by default uses [PyTorch 2.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/). At the time of writing (Dec 29, 2022) this makes `torch.compile()` available in the nightly release. The improvement from the one line of code is noticeable, e.g. cutting down iteration time from ~250ms / iter to 135ms / iter. Nice work PyTorch team!

## todos

- Investigate and add FSDP instead of DDP
- Eval zero-shot perplexities on standard evals (e.g. LAMBADA? HELM? etc.)
- Finetune the finetuning script, I think the hyperparams are not great
- Schedule for linear batch size increase during training
- Incorporate other embeddings (rotary, alibi)
- Separate out the optim buffers from model params in checkpoints I think
- Additional logging around network health (e.g. gradient clip events, magnitudes)
- Few more investigations around better init etc.

## troubleshooting

Note that by default this repo uses PyTorch 2.0 (i.e. `torch.compile`). This is fairly new and experimental, and not yet available on all platforms (e.g. Windows). If you're running into related error messages try to disable this by adding `--compile=False` flag. This will slow down the code but at least it will run.

For some context on this repository, GPT, and language modeling it might be helpful to explore transformer architectures and creative text generation. ATOM-GPT focuses specifically on metal music content generation and provides specialized tools for training on metal lyrics datasets.
